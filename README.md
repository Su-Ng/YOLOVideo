# YOLOVideo
Machine Learning has many applications. In this repository I have a program using a video clip to show how objects on the road can be detected and recognized.This shows that the trained YOLO algorithm has found 3 objects, person, car and traffic light and a bounding box is drawn over the objects that are found.
